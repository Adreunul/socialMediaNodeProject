A social media Web Application where users can create and manage accounts, write/edit/delete posts and interact(like/comment/save) with other users posts.

Along with developing this Web App, I am developing my skills with using node.js with express.js and building RESTful APIs. For the frontend I am using vanilla javascript and bootstrap.

It's going to be the first time that I develop a web app full stack on my own and the first time that I use the mentioned frameworks. and I'm looking forward to it. Node.js is really cool to work with.
